This is a sample module that establishes an independent connection to Elasticsearch and can run quieries independent of the Liferay search API.
Right now it requires a custom elasticsearch module found here https://github.com/dylan-rebelak/liferay-portal/tree/es-module-sample and included as a built jar in module resources.
